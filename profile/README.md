a dev & security researcher with a passion for low-level engineering and automation. I read, write, and break code for both fun and profit, and build automated solutions to streamline workflows.

### Languages

- Rust – for malware development and infrastructure tools  
- Python – for scripting, automation, and rapid prototyping  
- Bash – for efficient shell scripting  
- Powershell – because sometimes, it's required

### What I Do

- Bug bounty hunting and vulnerability research  
- Reverse engineering and binary analysis  
- Developing custom tools and C2 infrastructure for red teaming
