I'm a developer and security researcher who loves getting close to the metal. I write code that talks to hardware, reverse engineer binaries for fun (and bugs), and automate everything I can.

### 💻 Languages I Speak:
- 🦀 Rust – for blazing fast, safe systems work  
- 🐍 Python – for scripting, automation, and quick PoCs  
- 🐹 Go – clean, powerful backend tools  
- 🐚 Bash – because real hackers still script in shell

### 🔬 What I Do:
- 🐞 Bug bounty hunting  
- 🔍 Reverse engineering on **Windows** & **Linux** (IDA Pro ftw)  
- 🧰 Offensive security with **Burp Suite Pro**, **Cobalt Strike**  
- 🛠️ Building tools and C2 infra for red teaming  
- 🧪 Writing custom implants, payloads, and recon scripts

### ⚙️ Tech I'm into:
- Low-level programming
- Malware analysis & development
- Binary exploitation
- Network protocol fuzzing
- Custom tooling for OSINT and recon
