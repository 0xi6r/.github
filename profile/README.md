I read, write, and break code for both fun and profit, and script automated solutions to streamline workflows.

### Languages

- Rust – for backend & red team & native tools  
- Python – for scripting, automation, and rapid prototyping  
- Bash – for efficient shell scripting  
- Powershell – because sometimes, you really need it

***

### What I Do
- Build backend infrastructures
- Bug bounty hunting and vulnerability research  
- Reverse engineering and binary analysis  
- Developing custom tools and C2 infrastructure for red teaming
